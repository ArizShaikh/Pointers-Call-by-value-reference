# Pointers-Call-by-value-reference

Aim : Program to pass parameters by Value and by Reference using pointers

Description : 
  There are two ways to pass arguments/parameters to function calls -- call by value and call by reference.
  
  The major difference between call by value and call by reference is that in call by value a copy of actual arguments 
  is passed to respective formal arguments. 
  While, in call by reference the location (address) of actual arguments is passed to formal arguments, hence any change 
  made to formal arguments will also reflect in actual arguments.
